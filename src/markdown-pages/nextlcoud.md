Want access to my media server? You're in the right place. I'm not streaming it over Plex anymore because the GPU usage spiked my energy bill, but you can still connect to the server and download the Movies and TV shows I have, no problem! I'm running a Nextcloud server, so if you set up the client it acts similarly to dropbox for you.

## Step 1: install Nextcloud client
Install nextcloud client on the device on which you plan to store the files (I recommend you main PC). You can hook up an external harddrive to this device for more storage. 
- https://nextcloud.com/clients/


## Step 2: connect you Nextcloud client to my server
Connect your nextcloud client to my server by pointing it to https://share.kyleleslie.dev

## Step 3: get login credentials
Text me (preferably over Signal) to get your username and password. Using these, you can connect your client to my server.

## Step 4: setup you Nextcloud settings
- Make sure to choose a selective sync (don't try and sync everything available on the server). I'll include screenshots here later, but essentially just choose the shows and movies you want.
- Recommended: Turn off the setting that requires confirmation for connecting to external storage and increadse the file-size limit for downloads. Most files are close to 1GB or larger

Congratulations! You have connected to my server and are downloading the files!
