## Food and Drink &#9749;
**Coffee and alcohol are always fun! And no clutter!**

**Coffee:**
- Whole beans (not ground)
- Something I haven't tried before

**Alcohol:**  
_(Help us slowly stock our liquor cabinet!)_  
- Any nice bottle of liquor we probably don't have (Hint: we don't have much haha)
- Fun beer I might not have tried (Note: any type is fine *except sour beer*)
- Wine: Always fun to try a new bottle together!

**Hotsauce:**   
_(always like trying new, tasty hot-sauces)_
- *Tasty > painful!* Interesting flavours and medium heat is more enjoyable than pure pain!
- Citrusy, fruity sauces with medium - high heat are fun

**Restaurants:**
- Restaurant gift-cards for brunch spots or dinner places are fun! Alicia and I love to go out to eat!

## Bags &#128092;	
**I love really nice backpacks and messenger bags/ sachels but don't have the money for them. Although I am picky about what I like when it comes to the style and quality of the bag &#128523;**

**Criteria:**
- Comfortable strap
- Sleek design
- Functional size (not too big or too small (holds my laptop + lunch + some pens/notebook)
- Neutral colours (no orange or pink please haha)

## Tech &#128190;
**Tech gadgets and accessories I would love to get but don't _need_**
- [A Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/series/home)
- [Rasperry Pi 4](https://www.buyapi.ca/raspberry-pi-4-information/)
  * I already have a 3B, but you can never have enough raspberry pis and I know that I could find a really fun use for another!
- External SSD
  * Can always use more storage! Especially as I improve and expand our media server + at home backups on the network
  * anything over 1TB (1000GB) and with usb3 or 3.1 is great!

**Toys:**

- Ideally somewhat durable
- He enjoys chew-toys like the antler we bought him

**Treats:**
- All treats are good  

**Misc:**
- Clothing (indoor or outdoor), petsmart/ dog store gift-cards
