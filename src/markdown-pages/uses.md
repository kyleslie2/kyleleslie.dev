### Media server ðŸ“º
**What I currently use for my home media server**

#### Hardware:
I use a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) left-over from my first year web development college course, and an old 1TB harddrive from Western Digital as a [NAS](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-nas/). Otherwise, just a strong internet connection and a [Chromecast](https://store.google.com/ca/product/chromecast) makes wirelessly managing my media library and creating a 'personal' Netflix super simple and easy.

#### Software:
I have [Plex Media server](https://www.plex.tv/en-ca/media-server-downloads/) installed on the Raspberry Pi, and the [Plex app](https://www.plex.tv/en-ca/media-server-downloads/#plex-app) downloaded on my phone, PC and Macbook. I use [Solid Explorer (paid app)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2&hl=en_CA) to manage downloads and copy files from my phone to my media server when convenient.

**Plans for the future**
- Sonarr
- Radarr
- Jackett
- Synology NAS

## Networking ðŸ“¡
**My home network setup**

**VPN: [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/)**  
Have been very happy with PIA for the last 2 years. Extremely intuitive UI, easy multi-device use, updates are really easy and they don't keep logs.


Router can't be near TV or PC so I use a [Powerline adapter](https://www.amazon.ca/Powerline-Network-Adapters/b?ie=UTF8&node=3312820011) for more consistent connection to the Nintendo Switch and the PC. Then I use a little [Ethernet switch](https://www.amazon.ca/TP-Link-TL-SF1005D-5-port-100Mbps-Desktop/dp/B000FNFSPY/ref=sr_1_12?fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1590843592&refinements=p_n_feature_two_browse-bin%3A7322393011&rnid=7322391011&s=electronics&sr=1-12) to split up the powerline connection and give more priority to whichever device I'm currently using.
