## macOS ï£¿
Applications I use and like on my Macbook. Some are Apple only, lots are cross-platform.  I try to stay away from Apple services like iCloud.  

[Check out this playlist for other application suggestions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD8VmuL7qc7iC3ssaPqt_oqgQw_OOSH3L)



### Text-editors and terminals
[See my post about my note-management solution](/note-management) for more details
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/): best terminal for mac
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/):  Most versatile text-editor/ IDE available.
    - [All my extensions and settings available here](https://gist.github.com/kyleslie2/b54b684e1fe4191b168291a853ad389c)
    - [Integrated Terminal in VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)
- [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/): Best cross-platform markdown editor for all my notes

### Media and files
- [Dropbox](dropbox.com): don't use it as much anymore, but still handy
- [IINA](iina.io): solid media player with more polish than VLC
- [Handbrake](handbrake.fr): for converting video files
- PopcornTime: for those movies you can't find on Netlix or Disney+... (use a VPN)
- [Syncplay](https://syncplay.pl/): for watching local movie files with friends remotely (without lag or bandwidth issues)
- [Syncthing](syncthing.net): amazing custom syncing between devices (I use it with my Zettlr notes and for moving things from my phone to my laptop)

- [Videostream](https://getvideostream.com/): for casting local files from your computer to the chromecast

### Ultilities
- [AppZapper](https://www.appzapper.com/) or [AppTrap](http://onnati.net/apptrap/): great utilities for removing all files from uninstalled applications permanently
- [BetterSnapTool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12): for customizing window-snapping and gestures (can't remember if paid or free). There are lots of apps like it now
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical): Probably the most powerful calendar app out there. Don't use it anymore since they moved to subscriptions, but worth mentioning if you want something like this
- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/): for controlling blue light
- [Unclutter](https://www.unclutterapp.com): great little utility for keeping jot notes, hiding files away temporarily and accessing your clipboard

- [Stuffit Expander](https://www.stuffit.com/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/): for expanding compressed files

### Other
- [KeepPassXC](https://keepassxc.org/): encrypted password vault. Moving to [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/) soon though

- [Signal](https://signal.org/en/): for messaging
- VPN: Used to use [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/), but currently going through 30 day trials of [VPNs that rate highly on this site](https://www.safetydetectives.com/best-vpns/) to see which one I like the most

### Media server ðŸ“º
What I currently use for my home media server

#### Hardware:
I use a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) left-over from my first year web development college course, and an old 1TB harddrive from Western Digital as a [NAS](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-nas/). Otherwise, just a strong internet connection and a [Chromecast](https://store.google.com/ca/product/chromecast) makes wirelessly managing my media library and creating a 'personal' Netflix super simple and easy.

#### Software:
I have [Plex Media server](https://www.plex.tv/en-ca/media-server-downloads/) installed on the Raspberry Pi, and the [Plex app](https://www.plex.tv/en-ca/media-server-downloads/#plex-app) downloaded on my phone, PC and Macbook. I use [Solid Explorer (paid app)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2&hl=en_CA) to manage downloads and copy files from my phone to my media server when convenient.

**Plans for the future**
- Sonarr
- Radarr
- Jackett
- Synology NAS (or homemade alternative)

## Networking ðŸ“¡
My home network setup

- VPN: Used to use [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/), but currently going through 30 day trials of [VPNs that rate highly on this site](https://www.safetydetectives.com/best-vpns/) to see which one I like the most. Current front-runners are [Mullvad](http://mullvad.net/en/) or [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/). Worst is definitely [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/)

Router can't be near TV or PC so I use a [Powerline adapter](https://www.amazon.ca/Powerline-Network-Adapters/b?ie=UTF8&node=3312820011) for more consistent connection to the Nintendo Switch and the PC. Then I use a little [Ethernet switch](https://www.amazon.ca/TP-Link-TL-SF1005D-5-port-100Mbps-Desktop/dp/B000FNFSPY/ref=sr_1_12?fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1590843592&refinements=p_n_feature_two_browse-bin%3A7322393011&rnid=7322391011&s=electronics&sr=1-12) to split up the powerline connection and give more priority to whichever device I'm currently using.
