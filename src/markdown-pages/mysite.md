### Why I made this website:
This site is based on 'relaxed fit development'
- Not concerned with it being perfect  
- Will act as a loose digital garden, so it needs to be flexible
- Wanted a place to dump some info and make things publicly available
- [Inspired by Scott Tolinski and Wes Bos via Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/show/249/hasty-treat-scott-s-new-personal-website)

### My progress 
(will add picture and write-ups later... probably)
- Created a Gatsby site using Gatsby starter
- Created custom react components for templating blog entries and pages
- Added tags for filtering posts
- Added Tailwind CSS 
- Added Google Analytics
- Created responsive navbar
- Using Flexbox
- Created markdown blog entry templating 

### Future goals
- Build a React webapp for recommending movies and TV 
- Properly style and propogate the blog, tags, portfolio entries on the landing page
- Actually 'finish' the blog posts I'm making for future reference
- Improve the style of the site once I'm happy with the functionality

### FAQ
(jk no one asks)
Do you think people will actually visit your site?
- No, this is purely for myself. If someone else finds something useful on here, all the better.

Do you recommend Gatsby or Tailwind?
- Gatsby 100% yes. Amazingly fast, well documented and simple once you get your head wrapped around all the GraphQL mechanics.
- Tailwind, I'm still getting used to, but I think yes also.

When do you work on this?
- A couple hours on the weekend. It's nice to produce some code outside of work for my own benefit.
